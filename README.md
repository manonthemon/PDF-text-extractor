# PDF-extractor

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

  ## Description 
  This is a simple python application which can be used to extract and translate texts from PDF files. 
  
  I've built this application to practice python basics such as:
  - Handling pdf files
  - Asking user for input
  - Using a variety of libraries such as fitz, pyperclip and googletranz
  - Writing loops
  - Writing batch files

## Usage

This application requires python, as well as the following libraries:

- pyperclip
- PyMuPDF
- googletrans

To use the application:

1. Launch the .bat file
2. Enter the path to the PDF file
3. The program will extract text and copy it to clipboard. 
4. The program will ask user if they want to translate the text and prompt language selection.
5. Translated text will be copied to clipboard.

 ## Contributing
I developed the text extraction part of the app following the instructions from https://automatetheboringstuff.com python course.

 ## Future development

 I'd like to create an executable file, to allow for this script to be run on any machine.
 I intend to add drag and drop functionality for PDF files or orther simpler form of file selection.
